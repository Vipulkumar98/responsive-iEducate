                Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character
                traits. There are many debates about its precise definition, for
                example, about which aims it tries to achieve. A further issue is
                whether part of the meaning of education is that the change in the
                student is an improvement. Some researchers stress the role of
                critical thinking to distinguish education from indoctrination. These
                disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of
                education. The term can also refer to the mental states and qualities
                of educated people. Additionally, it can mean the academic field
                studying education.

                Education in India is primarily managed by the state-run public
                education system, which falls under the command of the government at
                three levels: central, state and local. Under various articles of the
                Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory
                Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a
                fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of
                the total number of public schools to private schools in India is
                10:3. Education in India covers different levels and types of
                learning, such as early childhood education, primary education,
                secondary education, higher education, and vocational education. It
                varies significantly according to different factors, such as location
                (urban or rural), gender, caste, religion, language, and disability.

                Ministry of Human Resource and Development, Government of India in
                collaboration with Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology
                has also launched a National Scholarship Portal to provide students of
                India access to National and State Level Scholarships provided by
                various government authorities. As a Mission Mode Project under the
                National e-Governance Plan (NeGP), the online service enlists more
                than 50 scholarship programs every year including the renowned
                Ministry of Minority Affairs (MOMA) Scholarships for Post-Matric and
                Pre-Matric studies. In the academic year 2017–18 the MOMA Scholarships
                facilitated the studies of 116,452 students with scholarships worth
                ₹3165.7 million.[242] The National Scholarship continues to enlist
                scholarship programs managed by AICTE (All India Council for Technical
                Education), UGC (University Grants Commission) and respective state
                governments.
